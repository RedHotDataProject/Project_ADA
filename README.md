# Open Food Facts: the carbon share we do not eat

# Abstract

In a century were agri-food industry is questionned on several aspects, we want to know more about world food productivity, comsumption, changing diet habits and  impacts on the environment of this mass production. In our project, we are eager to gain deeper insight into the agri-food industry and its impacts on humans and environment. Through the Open Food Facts dataset,  we will try to explain and visualize this changing world. Our story will start on the difference of producing accordind to each country, this could explain the habits of differents cultures and the impact on our environment. Figures, maps, histograms and other kind of plots will help the explanation of our hypothesis. 

A 150 word description of the project idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? What's the motivation behind your project?

# Research questions
Are most commonly used ingredients changing aver time? What are the environmental impact of those trends? How new diets/movements (veganism etc) are apearing in each country? Have sustainability policies  an impact on the way to produce?

# Dataset
The free food product database will give us the food production information (from the locations of production to the most commun ingredients and its nutrition indices to the carbon footprint). To illustrate the impact of the production in our society, we want to cross this dataset with indices of health such as obesity, diabetes etc. Also, a dataset with the sustainability policies taken in terms of food production is complementary to add an environmental aspect. 

List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
For milestone 2, November 25th, we will look at the datasets deeper. In other words, we will start cleaning the data, looking at correlated parameters and crossing datasets.

Add here a sketch of your planning for the next project milestone.

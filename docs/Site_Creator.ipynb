From growing, farming, processing and packaging our food, energy and organic resources are consumed and released, which reflects in the emission of greenhouse gases, such as CO<sub>2</sub>. In this story, we explore the arcane of the food industry, such as its manufacturing, product composition and sales, and delve into its carbon emission as well as its nutrition standards of quality. Using the <a href=\"https://world.openfoodfacts.org\">Open Food Facts</a> dataset as well as <a href=\"http://www.eaternity.org\">Eaternity</a>'s, we present the carbon footprint repartition, starting on an understanding of the products, followed by the breakdown of production countries as well as point of sales and evaluating trends in diet composition, with a special focus on nutritionally high marked products in France and the UK. With this study, we want to provide a better understanding of the agri-food industry, and eventually help reducing carbon emissions by promoting a healthier product base for our consumption.\n",
